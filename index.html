        <h1>Hello! My name is Krrish Lala. Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <h5>I am 13 years old. I study in class 9N of Our Own High
School, Al warqa, Dubai. I like coding, robotics and 3D designing. I like these
activities because it helps me improve my creativity and technical skills. I
want to improve my skills in areas such as app development, web
development and RPA, public speaking. I want to
become a better speaker and I would like to participate in more community
service programs as I believe that we should give back to our community in
whatever way possible.

Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World health organization on 11th March 2020. Since then, it has greatly disrupted normal life.
        Offices and schools were shut down, global air travel was restricted, lockdowns were announced.
        During the lockdown times, students were attending schools from the comfort of their houses, thereby saving travel daily time of 1-2 hours. I decided to use this precious time saved, to learn new skills.</h5>
